# Programming Languages on Coursera

> [This course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/programming-languages) is an introduction to the basic concepts of programming languages, with a strong emphasis on **functional programming**. The course uses the languages ML (in [Part A](https://www.coursera.org/learn/programming-languages)), Racket (in [Part B](https://www.coursera.org/learn/programming-languages-part-b)), and Ruby (in [Part C](https://www.coursera.org/learn/programming-languages-part-c)) as vehicles for teaching the concepts, but the real intent is to teach enough about how any language “fits together” to make you more effective programming in any language -- and in learning new ones.
